# Development 💻

We are using the Visual Studio Code Dev Containers extension to use a container as a full-featured development environment. Learn more about [developing inside a container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).




To begin development on the App, open `./App/` in your IDE and run `npm run start` to begin local development.

To begin development on the Functions, open `./Functions/index.js` in your IDE and begin development. You will want to use `firebase emulators:start` to leverage Firebase Local Emulator Suite for debugging. It is suggested that you are developing with the most recent LTS version of Node (v18.x.x as of writing).
